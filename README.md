Internship on machine learning
## Iris Flower Classification
>This ML model predicts the species of iris flower  ie. setosa virginica versicolor based on the length and width of petals and sepals
>It uses Support vector machine algorithms to make predictions
>The dataset is preloaded in sklearn.datasets
## House Price Prediction model
>This Ml Model predict the price of the house based on the area given in ft
>It uses Linear Regression algorithm to do so.
>The dataset is loaded as a csv file.
